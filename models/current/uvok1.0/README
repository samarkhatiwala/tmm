This is version 1.0 of UVOK, an interface to the Kiel version of the biogeochemical model 
embedded in the University of Victoria Earth System Climate Modle (UVic ESCM). (As you 
will have guessed, ``UVOK'' stands for the Universities of Victoria, Oxford and Kiel.) 

To run this model requires a number of components that are not distributed here: 
1) The full, updated UVic ESCM 2.9 model code available from: UVic_ESCM.2.9.updated.tar.gz (2013-8-1) 
at http://wikyonos.seos.uvic.ca/model/
2) Modifications to (1) involving extensive changes of the biogeochemical model and 
code implementing transport matrix extraction and interfacing of the biogeochemical 
model to the TMM: http://kelvin.earth.ox.ac.uk/spk/Research/TMM/Kiel_Jan_2017_updates_to_UVIC2.9.tar.gz 
or https://thredds.geomar.de/thredds/catalog/open_access/Kiel_Jan_2017_updates_to_UVIC2.9/catalog.html.

Once you have all the above components, edit Makefile in src/ to set the variables BASE1 
to point to the toplevel of Kiel_Jan_2017_updates_to_UVIC2.9; BASE2 to the version 2.9 
updates directory; and BASE3 to the main 2.9 source tree.

Then compile with:
make smallf
make tmmuvok
