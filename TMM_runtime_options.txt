The TMM driver code is implemented in PETSc, which provides a flexible set of 
routines for setting run-time options via command line arguments. These options 
can also be read from a file or given in an environment variable. Options fall 
into two categories: those for the TMM library and model-specific options. The 
most important ones for the former are listed below (some are required, others 
are optional and take on default values).

The TMM library allows one to simultaneously simulate multiple instances of a model. 
To do this we make use of the fact that PETSc options also take a "prefix"; this allows 
one to set the same option (with different values) for different model instances by 
prefacing it with the prefix. Prefixes can be specified at runtime with the -prefix 
option. Thus, to run two model instances with prefixes m1_ and m2_ we do: 
-prefixes m1_,m2_. Many of the options listed below can then be prefaced with these 
prefixes to specify options for the corresponding instance. (Exceptions are options 
such as -max_steps that apply to all model instances.) For example, input and output 
file names, respectively, for the first instance can be specified via: 
-m1_i f1in,f2in ... -m1_o f1out,f2out ...

1) To specify number of tracers: -numtracers NN, where NN is an integer. By default this is 1.

2) To specify the maximum number of time steps to run the model: -max_steps NN, where NN is an 
integer.

3) You can specify initial conditions (tracer concentrations) in two ways:
  a) With the -i option: -i XX,YY,... where XX, YY etc are the file names (strings). 
     You must provide as many file names as the number of tracers.
  b) With the -pickup option: -pickup XX, where XX is the name of the pickup (restart) 
     file. This file should contain as many vectors as the number of tracers.

4) To specify the names of output files: -o XX,YY,... where XX, YY etc are the file names 
(strings). You must provide as many file names as the number of tracers.

Note: input and output files are in PETSc binary format.

5) To specify output frequency (in time steps): -write_time_steps NN, where NN is an integer.

The -write_time_steps option is controlled by a step timer object (see Sec #10) with prefix 
"write". Thus, you can optionally control the output frequency more precisely by passing 
-write_time_steps a comma separated list of frequencies (Sec #10(a)(ii)), specify its start 
time (-write_start_time_step NN; see Sec #10(b)), or specify a reset frequency with 
-write_start_time_step_reset_freq NN (Sec #10(c)).

A couple of other related output options are -append (which will append output to the 
files specified by the -o option rather than the default behavior of overwriting them) 
and -time_file XX (which will write the output times to a text file called XX rather 
than the default 'output_time.txt').

Sometimes it is useful to write some tracers at a higher (or different) frequency than 
the standard output. This can be done via the "-write_extra" option and then specifying 
the indices of tracers to write out (e.g., -write_extra_tracer_indices 0,3,7), their 
filenames (e.g., -o_extra tr0_extra.petsc,tr3_extra.petsc,tr7_extra.petsc) and whether 
to append output (-append_extra), their output times (-time_file_extra XX, default is 
"output_time_extra.txt"), and the output frequency via the extraWriteTimer StepTimer 
object with prefix "write_extra". All StepTimer object options are supported 
(-write_extra_start_time_step, -write_start_time_step_reset_freq). See Sec #10.

IMPORTANT: See the note at the end of Sec #10.

6) At the end of every run, the driver writes out a restart or pickup file that contains 
the tracer fields at the end of the integration. By default it is called 'pickup.petsc'. 
But you can specify the name of this file with the -pickup_out XX option, where XX is 
the desired filename (string). Next time you want to start from this initial condition just 
specify the file name: -pickup XX.

You can also write intermediate pickup files at a specified frequency (in time steps) 
by using the option -pickup_time_steps NN, where NN is an integer. This is controlled by 
a step timer object with prefix "pickup", and thus can be configured more precisely with 
options similar to those described in Sec #5 and Sec #10.

7) The driver uses an internal 'clock' to keep track of time (e.g., for interpolating 
forcing or transport matrices to the current time). The unit of this 'clock' is arbitrary 
but any other time information you specify to the TMM driver must be in that unit. (The 
exception is the physical time step required to convert the source/sink tendency term into 
a discrete-in-time term. This is usually done via an option such as: -biogeochem_deltat XX.)
Output times (see above) are written in the same units. 

You control the clock by specifying the length of a time step (in your chosen unit) via: 
-deltat_clock XX, where XX is a floating point number. Thus, if the unit of time is a year 
then XX is the time step in years. For example, if your model takes 2 timesteps per day 
and your year has 360 days, then you would specify: -deltat_clock 0.0013888888888889, 
where 0.0013888888888889 is simply 1/(360*2). Note that you must use specify the value in full 
double precision (16 decimal places). In Matlab this would be: sprintf('%17.16f',1/(360*2)). 
Similarly, for a 365-day year: -deltat_clock 0.0013698630136986.

By default the clock start at time=0.0. You can change this via the -t0 XX option, where XX is 
your desired time origin. You can also optionally specify the corresponding starting iteration 
number with -iter0 NN, where NN is an integer (by default 0). These options are useful if, for 
example, you're restarting a run and want to record the correct output times.

8) Transport matrices:
 a) To specify the name or prefix of the explicit transport matrix: -me XX, where XX is a string.
 b) To specify the name or prefix of the implicit transport matrix: -mi XX, where XX is a string.

TMs can be constant, periodic or fully time-dependent. Periodic TMs can be specified with the 
-periodic_matrix option, and time-dependent ones with -time_dependent_matrix. If neither is 
specified then TMs are assumed constant and are read from PETSc-formatted sparse matrix files 
XX and YY specified with -me XX and -mi YY.

If TMs vary in time, the strings specified with -me XX and -mi YY are then interpreted as 
prefixes for file names of the form XX_NN and YY_NN, where NN is a suffix generated from an 
integer with the sprintf specifier "%02d". The first file will always be XX_00, etc. For example, 
for monthly-mean TMs, NN = 00, 01, 02, ..., 11 and the driver will try to read files XX_00, XX_01, 
..., XX_11 and YY_00, YY_01, ..., YY_11. See the next section for how to specify the times at which 
the TMs are given.

9) As mentioned above, the internal clock is used for interpolating transport matrices and 
forcing fields to the current time step. The times at which these TMs and fields are given 
must also be in the units of the internal clock and for periodic data this requires providing 
additional information to the TMM driver via a set of extra options. For example, if the unit 
of time is year and your circulation has a periodicity of 1 year you would specify that with: 
-matrix_cycle_period 1.0. But you also need to tell the driver how many TMs it should read 
and how these are spaced apart over the year. The former is given via the -matrix_num_per_period NN 
option, where NN is an integer giving the number of TMs per period. Thus, for monthly-mean TMs, 
you would have: -matrix_num_per_period 12. If only this option is given, the driver will 
assume the TMs are spaced apart equally over the course of a period and assign times to them 
accordingly. However, if the TMs are not equally spaced then you need to provide the corresponding 
times via: -matrix_periodic_times_file XX, where XX is the name (string) of a binary file containing 
the times at which the TMs are given (in units of the internal clock). This is useful, for instance, 
if your year has 365 days with different days per month and you want to tell the driver that the TMs 
are given at the middle of each month. (See below for how to create such a file.)

The binary files with the time specification of periodic fields can be created in Matlab as follows:

% For monthly-mean fields with a 365-day year:
dpm=[31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31];
cdpm=cumsum(dpm);
dpy=sum(dpm);
N=length(dpm);
t=zeros(N,1);

t(1)=dpm(1)/2;
for it=1:N-1
  t(it+1)=cdpm(it)+dpm(it+1)/2;
end

write_binary('periodic_times_365d.bin',t/dpy,'real*8’)

% For 6-hourly fields with a 365-day year:
dpm=repmat(1,[365*4 1]);
cdpm=cumsum(dpm);
dpy=sum(dpm);
N=length(dpm);
t=zeros(N,1);

t(1)=dpm(1)/2;
for it=1:N-1
  t(it+1)=cdpm(it)+dpm(it+1)/2;
end

write_binary('periodic_times_6hourly.bin',t/dpy,'real*8')

For fully time-dependent TMs, the options are -matrix_num_times NN, where NN is 
the total number of TM files and -matrix_times_file time_file, the name of the 
binary file with the corresponding times.

Note that all binary files must be in IEEE big endian format and 64 bit precision.

10) Time averaging: The driver can optionally accumulate and write out time averages of tracer fields 
if you specify: -time_avg. You must then also give the names of files to which time-averaged output 
is to be written for each tracer via: -avg_files XX,YY ... where XX, YY etc are the file names (strings). 
You must provide as many file names as the number of tracers. 

If you're restarting your run from a previous integration you can optionally append the time averages 
to existing files (of the same name as given by arguments to -avg_files) with the -avg_append flag.

The times at which time averages are written are written by default to 'time_average_output_time.txt'. 
You can write this to a different file with: -avg_time_file XX, where XX is the name of a text file. 

Time averaging is controlled by a "step timer" object with prefix "avg". This allows you to customize 
several aspects of the averaging (or anything else the timer object is used for) at run time. In particular:

 a) -avg_time_steps lets you specify the averaging interval. (You MUST specify this option.) 
 This option takes two forms:

   i) If the averaging interval is fixed: -avg_time_steps NN, where NN is an integer giving the 
   number of time steps over which to average.

   ii) If the averaging interval varies: -avg_time_steps NN,MM,...,PP where NN,MM,...,PP is a comma-separated 
   list of integers giving the number of time steps over which to average. The driver will first average 
   over NN time steps, then MM time steps, and so on. When it gets to the end of the list (PP), the 
   list starts over again with NN. This option is useful if, for example, your year is 365 days and you're 
   interested in calendar month averages. In this case the number of days per month and hence the number 
   of time steps per month (and over which you wish to average) varies over the course of each year. 
   Thus, if your simulation take 2 time steps per day (and assuming that the number of days per month for a 
   nominal, no-leap, 365-day year is: 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31): 
   -avg_time_steps 62,56,62,60,62,60,62,62,60,62,60,62

 b) If, for example, you're doing a long spin-up run, you may only want to write out averages in, say, 
 the last year of the integration. In that case use: -avg_start_time_step NN, where NN is an integer specifying 
 the absolute (i.e., including iter0) time step at which (and including) to start accumulating time averages. 
 By default this is iter0 + 1. Thus, if your simulation starts at iter0=0, takes 720 time steps per year and 
 you want to start time averaging in the 2nd year: -avg_start_time_step 721.

 c) Lastly, if, for example, you want to do averages at intervals (e.g., taking an average of only Januaries, 
 an annual average every 10 years, or monthly averages for a year every 100 years),  you can do this via the 
 option -avg_start_time_step_reset_freq NN, where NN is the number of time steps by which you want to want 
 to increment the start time step once the number of (or sum of the sequence of) time steps specified by 
 -avg_time_steps is completed. Here are some examples:

 (1) Average for 60 time steps starting at step 1, 3601, 7201 etc (i.e., average of Januaries (assuming 
 60 steps/month) every 5 years): 
 -time_avg -avg_start_time_step 1 -avg_time_steps 60 -avg_start_time_step_reset_freq 3600

 (2) Take 3 averages of 60 time steps each starting at step 1, 3601, 7201 etc (i.e., average of Januaries, 
 Februaries and Marches (assuming 60 steps/month) every 5 years):
 -time_avg -avg_start_time_step 1 -avg_time_steps 60,60,60 -avg_start_time_step_reset_freq 3600

 (3) Average for 720 time steps starting at step 1, 3601, 7201 etc (i.e., annual averages (assuming 
 720 steps/year) every 5 years):
 -time_avg -avg_start_time_step 1 -avg_time_steps 720 -avg_start_time_step_reset_freq 3600

 (4) Average for 720 time steps starting at step 1, 3601, 7201 etc (i.e., annual averages (assuming 
 720 steps/year) every 5 years):
 -time_avg -avg_start_time_step 1 -avg_time_steps 720 -avg_start_time_step_reset_freq 3600

 (5) Do monthly averages every 10 years (1st year, 11th year, 21st year, etc.) (assuming 1095 steps/year 
 and unequal number of steps per month):
 -time_avg -avg_start_time_step 1 -avg_time_steps 93,84,93,90,93,90,93,93,90,93,90,93 -avg_start_time_step_reset_freq 10950

 (6) Do monthly averages every 10 years (1st year, 11th year, 21st year, etc.) (assuming 720 steps/year 
 and equal number of steps (60) per month):
 -time_avg -avg_start_time_step 1 -avg_time_steps 60,60,60,60,60,60,60,60,60,60,60,60 -avg_start_time_step_reset_freq 7200

 Here is some additional information about this option:
  - The value of the reset frequency is programmatically available via the PetscInt field startTimeStepResetFreq 
    of the timer object (e.g., avgTimer.startTimeStepResetFreq).

  - The start time is incremented when updateStepTimer is called AND if you’re at the end of the sequence of 
    steps specified by the option -avg_time_steps. If you only specify a single number for this option then the 
    start time will be incremented after those many time steps. (This is important. See examples above, especially 
    1, 4 and 5.)

  - When the start time is incremented the flag haveResetStartTimeStep is set to PETSC_TRUE. This allows the 
    user to programmatically check if the start time has been incremented, e.g.,

	if (avgTimer.haveResetStartTimeStep) {
	  do something
	}

Everything described above for the averaging step timer object applies to any step timer object. Thus, for any 
step timer object with prefix PREFIX (e.g., "write", "pickup", "write_extra"), the following command line options 
can be specified: -PREFIX_time_steps, -PREFIX_start_time_step and -PREFIX_start_time_step_reset_freq. However, 
see the note below.

IMPORTANT: step timer objects for writing out instantaneous outputs at specific time steps work slightly different 
from those used for time averaging. In particular, for objects such as -write_, -write_extra, -pickup_, -atm_write_, 
etc, in the -PREFIX_start_time_step NN option, NN can be set to any value >= Iter0. If -PREFIX_start_time_step is 
not given, NN will default to Iter0 (0 or that set via the -iter0 option). This means that the initial field of 
whatever it is you're writing out (corresponding to absolute time step Iter0) can also be written out (and will be 
by default if you don't specify -PREFIX_start_time_step). To handle this correctly requires a few extra lines of 
code so if you're trying to add a step time object to your own model have a look at tmm_write.c (and the associated 
calls in tmm_main.c). On the other hand, for timer objects used to do averaging, NN can be set to any value > Iter0. 
If -PREFIX_start_time_step is not given, NN will default to Iter0+1 so that time averaging starts at and includes 
the first time step.

11) Forcings: In addition to transporting tracers you can include source/sink terms ("forcings"). The TMM 
driver allows this to be specified in three ways, any combination of which can be turned on: 
 a) Forcing term read from file (can be periodic, constant, or time-dependent) with: -forcing_from_file
 b) External forcing computed in S/R calcExternalForcing: -external_forcing
 c) Boundary conditions switched on via -prescribed_bc and either calculated (with -calc_bc and calculated 
 in S/R calcBC) or read from file (periodic, constant, or time-dependent).

Forcing vectors are assumed discrete in time i.e., already multiplied by any physical time step before 
being read from file or in calcExternalForcing. We consider each in turn below.

a) Forcing term read from file: If the option -forcing_from_file is given you must then also 
provide a list of file names via: -forcing_files XX,YY,..., where XX, YY etc are the file names 
(strings). You must provide as many file names as the number of tracers. Forcing is assumed 
discrete in time i.e., already multiplied by any physical time step.

There are now three possibilities: 
i) Periodic forcing: -periodic_forcing
In this case the file names specified with -forcing_files are interpreted as prefixes as described 
above (#8) for TMs. Also, as described above (#9) for TMs, you must specify the times at which 
the periodic forcing is given via the options: -forcing_cycle_period, -forcing_num_per_period 
and -forcing_periodic_times_file. (These work identically to the corresponding matrix options.)

ii) Time-dependent forcing: -time_dependent_forcing
In this case you must specify the number of forcing vectors being provided: 
-forcing_num_times NN as well as a binary file (see #9) with their corresponding times via: 
-forcing_times_file time_file

In this case the file names specified with -forcing_files are interpreted as files that 
contain ALL NN forcing vectors in each file.

iii) Constant forcing: if neither -periodic_forcing or -time_dependent_forcing are given, the forcing 
is assumed constant in time.

You can specify a time step after which forcing read from file is switched off via the 
-forcing_from_file_cutoff_step NN option.

Lastly, if periodic or time dependent forcing is specified, you can write out the (interpolated) 
forcing vectors via: -ouf file_list. Additionally, if -time_avg is specified, then you must also specify 
a list of file names to which to write out the time-averaged forcing via -ufavg_files file_list.
  
b)  External forcing: If the option -external_forcing is given then the (time discrete) forcing is 
computed by a user-provided function called calcExternalForcing.

You can specify a time step after which external forcing is switched off via the 
-external_forcing_cutoff_step NN option.

You can write out the calculated external forcing vectors via: -ouef file_list. Additionally, 
if -time_avg is specified, then you must also specify a list of file names to which to write out the 
time-averaged forcing via -uefavg_files file_list.

c) Prescribed boundary condition: -prescribed_bc
These can be either calculated (option switched on by -calc_bc and computed in S/R calcBC) or, if -calc_bc is 
not specified, then read from file. If the BC is being calculated 'on-the-fly', you must specify the length 
of the BC vector via -bc_vec_size NN. This length NN will be subsequently used to set correct sizes for the 
boundary TMs (see below). For the second option, you must specify a list of file names via -bc_files.

There are three possibilities for reading BCs from file:
(i) Periodic BC: -periodic_bc
In this case the file names specified with -bc_files are interpreted as prefixes as described 
above (#8) for TMs. Also, as described above (#9) for TMs, you must specify the times at which 
the periodic BCs are given via the options: -bc_cycle_period, -bc_num_per_period 
and -bc_periodic_times_file. (These work identically to the corresponding matrix options.)

(ii) Time-dependent BC: -time_dependent_bc
In this case you must specify the number of BC vectors being provided: 
-bc_num_times NN as well as a binary file (see #9) with their corresponding times via: 
-bc_times_file time_file. (These work identically to the corresponding matrix options.)

In this case the file names specified with -bc_files are interpreted as files that 
contain ALL NN BC vectors in each file.

(iii) Constant BC: if neither of the above options are given.

If prescribed BCs are being used, then you must specify boundary TMs via -mbe and -mbi. These 
options work similarly to those of the main TMs, i.e., boundary TMs can be constant, periodic 
or time-dependent. Their characteristics along with any time info are inherited from the main TMs.
